                            <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
    <p>Fully grown giraffes stand 4.3–5.7 m (14.1–18.7 ft) tall, with males taller than females.[44][45][46] The tallest recorded male was 5.88 m (19.3 ft) and the tallest recorded female was 5.17 m (17.0 ft) tall.[44][47] The average weight is 1,192 kg (2,628 lb) for an adult male and 828 kg (1,825 lb) for an adult female with maximum weights of 1,930 kg (4,250 lb) and 1,180 kg (2,600 lb) having been recorded for males and females, respectively. Despite its long neck and legs, the giraffe's body is relatively short.Located at both sides of the head, the giraffe's large, bulging eyes give it good all-round vision from its great height.Giraffes see in colour and their senses of hearing and smell are also sharp.The animal can close its muscular nostrils to protect against sandstorms and ants.
    The giraffe's prehensile tongue is about 45 cm (18 in) long.It is purplish-black in colour, perhaps to protect against sunburn, and is useful for grasping foliage, as well as for grooming and cleaning the animal's nose.The upper lip of the giraffe is also prehensile and useful when foraging, and is covered in hair to protect against thorns. The tongue and inside of the mouth are covered in papillae.
    <p>The coat has dark blotches or patches (which can be orange, chestnut, brown, or nearly black in colour separated by light hair (usually white or cream in colour.Male giraffes become darker as they age.The coat pattern has been claimed to serve as camouflage in the light and shade patterns of savannah woodlands.When standing among trees and bushes, they are hard to see at even a few metres distance. However, adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of an approaching predator, relying on their size and ability to defend themselves rather than on camouflage, which may be more important for calves.Each individual giraffe has a unique coat pattern.Giraffe calves inherit some coat pattern traits from their mothers, and variation in some spot traits are correlated with neonatal survival.The skin underneath the blotches may serve as windows for thermoregulation, being sites for complex blood vessel systems and large sweat glands.
    The skin of a giraffe is mostly gray, or tan.Its thickness allows the animal to run through thorn bushes without being punctured.The fur may serve as a chemical defence, as its parasite repellents give the animal a characteristic scent. At least 11 main aromatic chemicals are in the fur, although indole and 3-methylindole are responsible for most of the smell. Because the males have a stronger odour than the females, the odour may also have sexual function.Along the animal's neck is a mane made of short, erect hairs.The one-metre (3.3-ft) tail ends in a long, dark tuft of hair and is used as a defense against insects.</p>
     <p>Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and open woodlands. They prefer Acacieae, Commiphora, Combretum and open Terminalia woodlands over denser environments like Brachystegia woodlands.The Angolan giraffe can be found in desert environments. Giraffes browse on the twigs of trees, preferring trees of the subfamily Acacieae and the genera Commiphora and Terminalia, which are important sources of calcium and protein to sustain the giraffe's growth rate.They also feed on shrubs, grass and fruit. A giraffe eats around 34 kg (75 lb) of foliage daily.When stressed, giraffes may chew the bark off branches. Although herbivorous, the giraffe has been known to visit carcasses and lick dried meat off bones.</p>
   <p>Giraffes are usually found in groups that vary in size and composition according to ecological, anthropogenic, temporal, and social factors.Traditionally, the composition of these groups had been described as open and ever-changing. For research purposes, a "group" has been defined as "a collection of individuals that are less than a kilometre apart and moving in the same general direction." More recent studies have found that giraffes have long-term social associations and may form groups or pairs based on kinship, sex or other factors, and these groups regularly associate with one another in larger communities or sub-communities within a fission–fusion society.The number of giraffes in a group can range from 1 up to 66 individuals.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the giraffes at F6, right next to the kaolas.</p>
